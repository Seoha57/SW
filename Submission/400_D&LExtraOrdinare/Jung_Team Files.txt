Character System
	Character Manager has all the information even enemies. On changing the scene,
 we can get the attributes that saved in the Character Manager. So, we must save the data
 into the Character Manager whenever we change the value in the character.

Item System
	Item generator function has been created as scriptable function.
 This helps us to create an item by clicking once in the unity.

Inventory System
	Inventory system stores a set number of items received through reward. A player
 must prioritize certain items over others in order to manage the amount of space available.
 This inventory is also used in the item upgrade scene. 

Reward system
	If we win the game, we get rewarded. The reward is randomized through a defined
 probability. This probability will result in higher rewards if you win a higher dungeon.
 Items received on the compensation screen are automatically saved in the inventory.

UI system
	I made all of the UI. I created the image through power point and rendered it in unity.
 I tried to make UI which is more convenient for people.

Item Crafting
	In Item Crafting, players can select two items what they want to crafting.
To upgrade, they have to select two items for the same rarity. Currently, we can composed 
with a 100% probability and no cost.

Store System
	In the store, we can buy the legends, items, gold, and jam. When you first start,
 we only have one warrior character, so we have to collect the gold and buy it at the store.
 In addition, if you need a some items for upgrade, you can buy in stores. And if you buy
 the item, it will come out randomly again.

Particle System
	In order to make a game of better quality, I made a particle system in the all of our scene.
 I wanted to make a simple one, so I made a white dusty particle with a black background on the lobby screen.
 And during the combat, there is a particle applied into the skills.
