Readme

First, when you start our game, you can get the 200 Gem. Using this gem, you can buy some Gold in the Store. Using this Gold, you can buy the items or Legends. We recommend using this gold to buy characters. But, we didn’t implement purchasing the Gem yet.

In the main scene, you can change the stage by touching Dungeon button. And touching the start button, it will be going to the dungeon that you selected. 
If you want to quit the game, touch the return key and touch quit.

In the LEGENDS scene, if you have archer and wizard, you can select the characters. When you get the character, you need to add the character’s attributes using the plus button for the first time. If you click an item, you can see the information on that and it can be equipped the item using the use button.  

In the ITEMS scene, if you have the same rarity Items, you can upgrade these two items by using the use button. When you combine two items, it will be upgraded to the first selected item.

In Dungeon, you can target the enemy by touching. When the target is changed you can see directly which enemy is targeted. 
You can use skills by touch skill buttons. The orange bar, at the bottom of the button, is a cool time. When the orange bar is disappeared, it means that you can use that.
Our stages have several dungeons(Dungeon 1: 2, Dungeon 2: 2, Dungeon 3: 3). You can’t exit when just one dungeon clear, must clear all dungeons. If you clear all dungeons, you can get all rewards. Items, one of the rewards, have a different probability depending on which stage you clear. But, if you die when you didn’t clear all, you will lose all equipped items and levels. Thus, if you feel the character’s level and items are not enough, don’t try the upper level dungeon. 
(hidden: you can exit dungeon when you touch return key on phone and touch quit. It is for playtesting. It can’t give any rewards but you won’t lose anything.)
